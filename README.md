Science Team Guide
=================

A guide for new Zooniverse project science teams. The aim is produce a document that can be given to new Zooniverse science teams. It should explain how things will work and roughly what to expect. It will give them key contacts and a timeline, and outline the tools we use (.e.g GitHub, Wordpress,Amazon AWS).

For now this will be done using  simple Markdown document. We can can move this into an HTML site, PDF or whatever later on.
